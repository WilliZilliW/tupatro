   the red boss), so the card reads the state itself — cheaper than threading
   the value through every call site.

   The chip number follows the *viewer*: the sharpener sits in a wallet, so
   the printed value answers "what is this card worth to me". The pure
   chipValue still takes the seat as a parameter, so nothing in the core
   learns who is looking, and in single player the viewer is the owner. */

     they say which card it can be swapped in for. Muted, so it never reads as
     a card that could follow suit.

     The party emblem is *not* behind that gate: a party is not a suit and
     cannot be followed, so printing it says nothing about what the card can
